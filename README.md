## Websites I Recommend  
* [More Me Know](https://www.youtube.com/@LaurenMormino)    
 I learned a lot about sewing bag from this site.  
 She calls it **More Me Know** because that is how you pronounce her last name  
 Her companion site where she sells fabrics and hardware can be found [_here_](https://moremeknow.com/)    

* My current favorite book [_Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-with-Dragon-Tattoo-audiobook/dp/B001G8MA4O/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1BB56G4JAGMZS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-i4P7ArtSzfQZ5cvpXSG2WwJ_5jpO1VVTaTst2PdApXO0YeyEtkPt1X3fOh-FgLAoFwkGwnFW6OE5N8AR5T_jg5qhLFbATjKqjX0o1_mdz07esbHSDcpMHsXDG6hN9mWSY-fWclRn-YGMEuTWDjHk9SuX0-RdZWahOP6mm8qgCdBp5iXgpb_zINBOjibNkfPnIwD0qSEbZvHNn30IHk__fiP2w8uhZbV8TFLGbc5ZVE.NhcWzbcRNcCOqYeXPxb2xQjUmcT_v9yA-vERfj4AbLw&dib_tag=se&keywords=girl+with+dragon+tattoo&qid=1737678911&sprefix=girl+with+dragon%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-3)    
 This is my 2nd time reading the book and working on the 3rd book in the series _The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest_  
 The books were made into 3 movies in Sweden and can be found subtitled in English.  
 There is an English version of the first book staring Daniel Craig before he made the first James Bond movie.
